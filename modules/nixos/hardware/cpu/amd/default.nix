      # https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.html#amd-pstate-driver-operation-modes
      # passive: In this mode, the driver behaves similarly to the legacy acpi-cpufreq driver, with the OS requesting specific performance states (P-states). It does not fully leverage the CPPC mechanism and is generally not the recommended choice.
      # active (EPP): In this mode, also known as Energy Performance Preference (EPP), the driver provides a simple "hint" to the CPU firmware, biasing it towards either performance or energy efficiency. The firmware then autonomously makes the final, granular frequency decisions based on real-time workload, thermal, and power conditions.
      # guided: This mode represents a hybrid approach. The OS governor requests a minimum and maximum performance level, and the hardware platform is then free to autonomously select the most appropriate frequency within that range.
